# BirhdayBot
Hi there! In August I made a telegram-bot for my buddy's birthday.
My "holop_bot" can work with various APIs. I also generated funny compliments using Markov chains and create my BOT_CONFIG.json file to try to answer a non-command messages using ntlk. I tried to use ML-algorithms, but decided to take it easy :)
Attention: there are some problems with file-pathes because of the zip-archive, but I ensure you'll understang this code's ideas. Thank you)
